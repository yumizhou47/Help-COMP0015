I am not sure if I am the only person who has doubts about the results of the coursework I and II, 
but there is a huge gap between the actual marks and my expected results.
I don't really understand I lost nearly half marks for making several coding inefficiencies in csw2. 
in this case, if I make 3-4 coding mistakes, would I actually get 0 marks?
As I was expected to spend some of my own time learning this course not entirely rely on the lectures,
I guess the coding style is entirely different among the resources online and books and
I was never told the very standard or optimal coding style in this course, 
this very harsh marking criterion makes no sense to me at least.

I want to know how you guys did in this two coursework.

Hi all, 
While we are on this topic I would like to say that I share Yicheng Zheng's concern on this.
I too (as well as my coding partner) am very perplexed by how I was graded in the second coursework. 
Twelve points out of forty (i.e. 30% of the overall grade) were deducted from my grade only due 
to what was defined in the feedback as a "minor point of improvement", and with no real explanation of such deduction. 

For anyone wondering, the "minor point of improvement" has to do with how I created a set from a list, 
and can be found in the attachment.
I would also be interested to know whether our group's and Yicheng Zheng's are isolated 
cases or whether a similar issue has been experienced by others too.

I have similar concerns..it does seem  that many got very low marks. 
I got 13/25 and 18/40. (or perhaps this is how hard Computing is.)

Hi everyone, 

Same thing here. We lost 14 points for tiny inefficiency in the code even though our programme produces correct
results AND we wrote additional tests. The points for improvement we got was that we could have 'generalised some 
tasks' and written 'extra helper functions'. I just don't see how that is worth 14 points, especially in a beginner course?

Seems really harsh?

Hi everyone,

my coding partner and I had exactly the same thing happen to us. Both assignments were graded quite harshly even though
especially our second program performed very well. Even in the feedback it was pointed out that we had included 
additional elements and overall written a well-functioning program. The improvement comments were minor, and the 
lecturer had looked over our program and told us it’s all fine - or even good. Considering how vague the computing 
grade guidelines given to us are, I find it unfair that after so much work and all the times we asked for feedback 
before submitting, our grade is lowered drastically by things we were told were not a big issue before submitting.

HI Everyone, 
I have to say we had the same thing happen to us for the first program, 
being graded super harshly - especially considering we weren't told we need to add anything extra than the 
base code in the guidelines. I recommend leaving a review of the module so we can spare the future beginner coders. 
I also agree with everyone that we had to put in way to many hours to be graded this harshly 
( We put in enough work for 2 modules)

Can we also mention the manual coding exams......

Hi everyone, 

I believe that the way grading works for courseworks in this module is that you get 70% if you do everything 
that you were required without mistake. Then if you also do additional stuff you might get some extra marks. 
In my case, I got 32/40 for coursework 2 and everything that was required in the brief was pretty much done perfectly. 
In order for the program to be as efficient as possible I wrote 2 helper functions: 

-one that would create a dictonary containing all the words in list_of_lines and the number of times each word appears, 
which makes the calculation of the first 3 text parameters very effiecient

-and one that would create a list of sentences from the list of lines, 
which helps avoid repeating code in the last 2 functions

The results for each signature were exactly the same as the ones posted by Rae on Moodle. 
I doubt that there was any way to improve the code, as the feedback only says "In future projects 
you could think about automating your testing. Well done, keep coding!" at the points for improvement section.

On top of this I created two additional functionalities:

-one that would print the first N(input by user) most frequent words in the text, 
and the number of times each of these appear

-and one that would find all positions of a given word in a text (exact line and column as it appears when you open the 
mystery texts with notepad). This wasn't easy at all to do.

Yet I still managed to somehow lose 20% of the grade. For the first coursework I didn't 
write any additional functionalities yet everything else was mostly fine, with 2 tiny points of improvement mentioned, 
and i got 64%, yet I definitely didn't screw up a third of the coursework.

Hence I believe you probably only get 70% for if you do what you were required without mistakes.


### 8.

Exact same here. My partner and I were expecting strong firsts for both of our courseworks, 
because we satisfied and qualified fully, according to what we were told to do - both programs worked perfectly, 
achieved all of the requirements of the coursework, the code was efficient AND we made additional features 
to bring our grade up, for both courseworks - tests and other features. We were expecting 75+ but received 65 
for the second coursework and something between 60-65 for the first one (can’t remember the exact mark,
my partner submitted it). He also told me we should get our grades reviewed. 
It seems very unfair considering we did everything we were told to do to get a first.

HI guys

Thank you for your reply.

I have raised my concern to my department tutor(Statistical Science), and I was advised to forward my concern
to the student representatives as there is going to have a meeting for them to discuss all the things.
my main concerns are:
1. Very harsh marking criterion despite this is only an lvl5 course for programming beginners.
2. According to what I have heard from the previous year students, they didn't even have written questions on ICA. 
It was really difficult for me to write program codes on paper after only 2-3 weeks of studying
(maybe I am the only one who found the exercises were pretty hard, I have to search many resources online to complete it, 
but in the meantime, I was required to write codes on paper as a beginner).

Overall, this course setting and marking criterion makes me not feel this is the right course for beginners and, 
to be honest, as a third-year student, this course has caused such a big problem for me to reach the requirement 
of my conditional offer(I would rather choose an lvl6 course instead).

I would advise you guys who share the same concern as me, get in touch with your department student 
representative as they are holding a meeting tmr. Hopefully, they will find out whether we are just isolated 
cases(we are just bad) or they will make some further arrangements).

Many thanks

YIcheng
