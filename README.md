# Course COMP0015 Introduction to Programming (Term 1, 19/20)
Let's save COMP0015!

# Introduction of COMP0015
Aims:
The module uses Python to give a grounding in the basic programming techniques of sequence, repetition, branching, and functions. Students also learn to use and manipulate data structures such as lists, dictionaries and sets to solve problems. Building on the fundamental skills, key object-oriented concepts are covered including the use of classes, objects and inheritance. At the end of the course, students will use some of the most popular Python libraries for data analysis. This is an intensely practical module and full student engagement outside of lectures and in lab classes is critical to successful completion of the module.

Learning outcomes:
On successful completion of the module, a student will be able to:
1.Understand why Python is a useful programming language for developers;
2.Design and develop applications using a large sub-set of the language effectively;
3.Design object-oriented programs with Python classes;
4.Use programming tools such as an integrated development environment (IDE) and debugger;
5.Use Python libraries for data analysis.

Content:
-Why Python?;
